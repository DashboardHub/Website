            <p>"DashboardHub has adopted a startup culture that promotes inclusivity and flexibility for those
                involved. A key aspect in making this a successful culture is the adoption of Open Source development in harmony
                with Remote Working. All of the team at DashboardHub are treated as equals and trusted to perform their tasks
                autonomously knowing they have the full support of the company's founders."</p>
